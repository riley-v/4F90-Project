# Thread Swamp
Using TraceCompass EASE scripting, we can learn more about a trace by looking at how a thread occupies the CPU. If a thread is constantly being interrupted by other processes, so that it is being starved, we can say that the thread is being swamped. The following code highlights bad smells of thread swamp by examining an execution trace on TraceCompass, and applying a global filter to highlight offending threads. <br />

First we need to get the necessary modules for the analysis. We need the Trace module to examine the trace events and the Filters module to apply the global filter.
```javascript
loadModule("/TraceCompass/Trace");
loadModule('/TraceCompass/Filters');
```

The *threshold* value is a user supplied value. It should be a number between 0 and 100. This value represents CPU usage as a percetage of the lifettime of a thread over the tracing period. If a thread occupies the CPU for longer than the threshold value, it will be highlighted. To set the variable, go to thread_swamp.js -> Run As... -> Run Configuration... -> Script arguments.
```javascript
var threshold = argv[0];
if(threshold==null || threshold > 100 || threshold < 0){
	print("Go to cpu_swamp.js -> Run As... -> Run Configuration... -> Script arguments and enter your desired threshold value (%) as the first parameter.")
	print("Make sure it is between 0 and 100.");
	exit();
}
threshold = threshold/100;
```

The *trace* variable is the trace to examine. The code will automatically examine the active trace. If no trace is active, a message will be displayed on the console informing the user.
```javascript
//get the active trace
var trace = getActiveTrace();
if(trace==null){
	print("No trace is active.");
	exit();
}
```

We will need to use the start and end times in various places throughout the program. The start time will be the timestamp of the first event, and the end time will be the timestamp of the last event.
```javascript
//the start and end times for the trace
var start_time = -1;
var end_time = -1;
```

Now, we have to parse the events of the trace. To do this, we will need to set up quite a few variables. We will store information for each thread in *swamp_list*. *iter* and *event* will be used to iterate through the trace. *track_list* will be a helper array to store the locations of threads in *swamp_list*. We will store the last timestamp that each thread was active in *last_active*, and the last *sched_switch* event will be stored in *last_sched_switch*. *entry_num* will contain the index of the last thread in *swamp_list* + 1. Finally, *prev* will contain the timestamp of the last *sched_switch* event for each CPU.
```javascript
//this block calculates, for each CPU, the time from the 'i'th sched_switch event to the 'i+1'th and matches that time with the corresponding thread id
print("Calculating thread durations...");

var swamp_list = [];
var iter = getEventIterator(trace);
var event = null;

var track_list = [];
var last_active = [];
var last_sched_switch = null;
var entry_num = 0;
var prev = [];
```

Here, we start iterating throught the events of the trace. We get an event, and set up the *start_time* and *prev* variables if they have not already been. If the event is a *sched_switch*, we continue to analyze it.
```javascript
while (iter.hasNext()){
	event = iter.next();
	var cpu_num = getEventFieldValue(event,"CPU");
	
	if(start_time==-1) start_time = event.getTimestamp().toNanos();
	if(prev[cpu_num]==null) prev[cpu_num] = start_time;

	if(event.getName()=="sched_switch"){
		last_sched_switch = event;
		var new_entry;

		var new_tid = getEventFieldValue(event, "prev_tid");
		if(new_tid==0) new_tid = new_tid + ":" + cpu_num;
```

If this thread is not already recorded in the *swamp_list*, then we create a new entry for the list and add it. The *last_active* variable is set to the current timestamp if the thread was not preempted; otherwise, it is set to -1.
```javascript
		if(track_list[new_tid]==null){
			new_entry = {
				tid: String(new_tid).split(":")[0],
				cpu: String(new_tid).split(":")[1],
				start: prev[cpu_num],
				end: event.getTimestamp().toNanos(),
				duration: event.getTimestamp().toNanos() - prev[cpu_num],
				inactive: 0
			}
			prev[cpu_num] = new_entry.end;
			if(getEventFieldValue(event, "prev_state") != "TASK_RUNNING"){
				last_active[new_tid] = new_entry.end;
			}else{
				last_active[new_tid] = -1;
			}
			
			swamp_list[entry_num] = new_entry;
			track_list[new_tid] = entry_num;
			entry_num++;
```

If the current thread has already been recorded in the *swamp_list*, then we update that entry. We set a new end entry, and update the duration. Additionally, if the *last_active* entry is not set to -1, we update the thread's period of inactivity.
```javascript
		}else{
			swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].end = event.getTimestamp().toNanos();
			swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].duration = swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].duration + (event.getTimestamp().toNanos() - prev[cpu_num]);
			if(last_active[new_tid] != -1) swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].inactive = swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].inactive + (prev[cpu_num] - last_active[new_tid]);
			
			prev[cpu_num] = event.getTimestamp().toNanos();
			if(getEventFieldValue(event, "prev_state") != "TASK_RUNNING"){
				last_active[new_tid] = swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].end;
			}else{
				last_active[new_tid] = -1;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Once the iteration is over, we set the end time to be the timestamp of the very last event.
```javascript
end_time = event.getTimestamp().toNanos();
```

Finally, we have to consider the very last event. In the previous loop, we were only looking at the "prev_" arguments in the *sched_switch* events. In order to analyze the last thread scheduled, we should look at the "next_" arguments in the last *sched_switch* event. For this reason, we recorded the last *sched_switch* event to be analyzed. In this step, we follow the same pattern as above. However, the syntax is a little different as we use the "next_" arguments.
```javascript
if(last_sched_switch!=null){
	var cpu_num = getEventFieldValue(last_sched_switch,"CPU");
	if(prev[cpu_num]==null) prev[cpu_num] = start_time;

	var new_entry;
	var new_tid = getEventFieldValue(last_sched_switch, "next_tid");
	if(new_tid==0) new_tid = new_tid + ":" + cpu_num;
	
	if(track_list[new_tid]==null){
		new_entry = {
			tid: String(new_tid).split(":")[0],
			cpu: String(new_tid).split(":")[1],
			start: prev[cpu_num],
			end: end_time,
			duration: end_time - prev[cpu_num],
			inactive: 0
		}
		swamp_list[entry_num] = new_entry;
		track_list[new_tid] = entry_num;
		
	}else{
		swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].end = end_time;
		swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].duration = swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].duration + (end_time - prev[cpu_num]);
		if(last_active[new_tid] != -1) swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].inactive = swamp_list[track_list[new_tid]].inactive + (prev[cpu_num] - last_active[new_tid]);
	}
}
```

We need to put the threads with the highest amount of swamping first in order to extract the proper threads. To do this, we sort *swamp_list* from the smallest time duration on CPU per lifetime ratio to the largest time duration on CPU per lifetime ratio.
```javascript
//sort the entries by swamping percentage
print("Sorting threads by swamp percentage...");

swamp_list.sort(function(a,b){return (1 - b.duration/(b.end-b.start-b.inactive)) - (1 - a.duration/(a.end-a.start-a.inactive))});
```

The global filter requires a regex to higlight the proper events. We create one in this step. Basically, we iterate through the sorted list, adding each thread id to the regex until the threads no longer fit within the threshold or the list ends. When a thread fits the threshold criteria, we print out its thread id and the percentage that it was swamped. This is calculated as 1 - (the thread's total duration on the CPU / (the thread's end time - the thread's start time - the thread's period of inactivity)).
```javascript
//this block creates a global filter
print("Creating filter...");

var regex = "";
var i = 0;
print("Swamped Threads: ");
while(i<swamp_list.length && 1 - swamp_list[i].duration/(swamp_list[i].end-swamp_list[i].start-swamp_list[i].inactive) >= threshold){
	if(swamp_list[i].cpu==null){
		if(regex==""){
			regex = "TID==" + swamp_list[i].tid;
		}else{
			regex = regex + " || TID==" + swamp_list[i].tid;
		}
		print(swamp_list[i].tid + ": " + (1 - swamp_list[i].duration/(swamp_list[i].end-swamp_list[i].start-swamp_list[i].inactive))*100 + "%");
	}else{
		if(regex==""){
			regex = "(TID==" + swamp_list[i].tid + " && CPU==" + swamp_list[i].cpu + ")";
		}else{
			regex = regex + " || (TID==" + swamp_list[i].tid + " && CPU==" + swamp_list[i].cpu + ")";
		}
		print(swamp_list[i].tid + "/" + swamp_list[i].cpu + ": " + (1 - swamp_list[i].duration/(swamp_list[i].end-swamp_list[i].start-swamp_list[i].inactive))*100 + "%");
	}
	
	i++;
}
```

Finally, we apply the global filter using the regex. If the regex is empty, we inform the user that no threads fit their criteria.
```javascript
if(regex!=""){
	applyGlobalFilter(regex);
	print("The filter was applied.");
}else{
	print("No threads were selected.");
}
```

This code can be found in "Code/Runtime Smell Detection". I ran the script on a trace that I created. I used the CPU burner stress to spawn eight workers to spin on the CPU for 20 seconds as I created that trace. When using the *thread_swamp_marker*, I set the threshold to 10%. We can see the console output of the analysis in the following screenshot:
![Console output](Screenshots/05-15_Console.png?raw=true)
Right away, we can see that the stress threads were all about 75% swamped. Using the cpu_hog_marker analysis, we could see that four workers went to CPU 0 and four went to CPU 1. Therefore, the 75% makes perfect sense. As all eight ran at the same time, each stress worker would have been equally swamped by the other three stress workers running on the same CPU. They each would have gotten only about 25% of the CPU during their running time, leading to a 75% swamping percentage. Next we can see that the idle processes for each CPU are about 74% swamped. The 74% swamping means that for they occupied a CPU for about 26% of their running time. Finally, we can see that three other threads were swamped above 10% of their running time. Here is the Control Flow view of the trace:
![Console output](Screenshots/05-15_Control_Flow.png?raw=true)
We can see that the offending threads have been highlighted. The idle process threads are offscreen in this screenshot.
