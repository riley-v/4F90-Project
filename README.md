<br />The code to use this project is located in the [Code](Code/) folder. Please import the folder "Runtime Smell Detection" into TraceCompass, then right click on "GUI.js" and select "Run as EASE script". This will open the Runtime Smell Detection view and allow you to use the different filters.
<br />The [Code](Code/) folder also contains code I used to create traces for testing.
