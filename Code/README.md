###### Runtime Smell Detection
Code for the filter scripts.

###### PriorityInversionDemo.java (Please read description)
Code used to create trace for June 11 conference. Adapted from the original code which featured three threads of different priorities (High Priority Printer, Sorter, and Low Priority Printer). These threads caused High Priority Printer to be priority inverted. Now features Waiter, which just sleeps and does nothing.
<br />Note: this program will never end since Waiter is never woken. You will have to manually terminate it.)
