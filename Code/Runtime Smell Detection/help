Runtime Smell Detection
	This project uses statistical measures to highlight potentially problematic threads in TraceCompass views. Problematic threads are identified using the concept of bad smells extended to execution traces.
	
To Use:

	Install the following add-ons:
		Trace Compass Scripting (Incubation)
		Trace Compass Scripting Javascript (Incubation)
		Trace Compass Filters (Incubation)
		
	Select the runtime smell you would like to detect form the dropdown list.
	
	Enter an appropriate threshold value.
	
	Click 'Detect'.

Available Runtime Bad Smells:

	Blob Thread
		Definition: a thread that contains most of its parent's implementation.
		Threshold: find threads whose time on any CPU is at least 'x'% of their parent's duration. (0 < x <= 100)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch, sched_process_fork, sched_process_exit
	
	CPU Hog
		Definition: a thread which occupies a lot of time on a CPU, blocking it from other threads.
		Threshold: find threads that occupy a CPU for at least 'x'% of the trace. (0 < x <= 100)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch
		
	Endless Waiting
		Definition: a thread that is put to sleep but never woken up.
		Threshold: find threads that are sleeping for at least 'x' seconds. (0 < x)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch, sched_process_exit
		
	Overthreading
		Definition: a family (children of the same parent) of threads which block each other from occupying the CPU by occupying it themselves.
		Threshold: find threads that are blocked by siblings for at least 'x'% of the time that they are runnable. (0 < x <= 100)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch, sched_process_fork, sched_process_exit
		
	Priority Inversion
		Definition: when a sleeping higher priority thread is preempted by a lower priority thread.
		Threshold: find threads that are priority inverted by lower threads at least 'x' times. (1 <= x)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch, sched_process_exit
		
	Thread Swamp
		Definition: when a thread is blocked from the CPU by other thread occupying the CPU.
		Threshold: find threads that are blocked for at least 'x'% of the time that they are runnable. (0 < x <= 100)
		Tracepoints Needed: sched_switch
